## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have made the following changes 
suggested by a CRAN team member:

* References to scientific publications related to the theoretical background 
and methods used in this package have been added to DESCRIPTION.
* All examples that take < 5 sec are running now. 
* Only examples that necessarily take > 5 sec will not run.
* Examples that necessarily write information will do so in a temporal directory.
* In other examples writing information in the user's home filespace is avoided 
by leaving the argument save as default (FALSE).
* All messages printed by our functions are now done using `message()`.
* Changed user's par() settings are now reset with an immediate call of `on.exit()`.

**Aditional comments**

* The main scientific publication describing the theoretical background of
phylogenetic analyses and methods used in this package is in the second round 
of reviews in the journal Evolution. Once the manuscript is published we will 
add this reference to the package description.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have made changes to correct notes 
derived from CRAN check:

There were 4 NOTES:

2 NOTES on r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, and 2 on r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64.
The two notes were the same for both platforms.

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE

  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  phylogenies (16:65)
  
  Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index.

* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... NOTE

  Maintainer field differs from that derived from Authors@R
  
  Maintainer: ‘"Marlon E. Cobos" <manubio13@gmail.com>’
  
  Authors@R:  ‘Marlon E. Cobos <manubio13@gmail.com>’
  
  
**Solutions**

The word phylogenies is not mis-spelled.

I excluded the VignetteBuilder field from Description as this package does not
include any vignettes for the moment.

I excluded quotations from the maintainer's name so author and maintainer do not
differ; it was "Marlon E. Cobos", now it is Marlon E. Cobos.

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  nichevol (12:14)
  
Action: All words were checked in DESCRIPTION. nichevol is not a grammar issue,
it is the package name.
