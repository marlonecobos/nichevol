## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have made the following changes:

* Shortened the package title to less than 65 characters.
* Changed some examples so no package installations are performed; example-data 
and documentation were added instead. 
* Prevented writing information in the working directory for a few non-tested 
examples that were still doing it. Now info is written in temporary directories.
* Package ape was added as a dependency to avoid problems when trying to obtain 
characteristics of phylogenetic plots for adding niche labels.

**Comments**

* NOTES may be produced because some names of researchers cited in the 
Description file are considered misspelled words; however, the names are correct.
